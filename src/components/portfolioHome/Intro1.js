                <p>My name's Jacob Chan, and I hail from the San Francisco Bay Area. I’m a student at the University of Toronto pursuing a major in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, and a double minor in Statistics and Mathematics.</p>
<p>Music and coding are two of my passions, and I see a lot of similarities between them. Both feel like creative outlets where I get to build things from scratch, they take a ton of focus, and they’re extremely rewarding when everything finally comes together! </p>
<p>I find coding powerful, and the pace of technology is only getting faster. Right now, I’m all about learning both in the classroom and hopefully in a work environment, and I look forward to applying my skills in the real world.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
