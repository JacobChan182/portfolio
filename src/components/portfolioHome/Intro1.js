                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Jacob Domingo Chan and I am currently a student at the University of Toronto.
                I am pursuing a major in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, and I am minoring in both Statistics and Mathematics.
                I am highly analytical and detail-oriented, with a passion for problem-solving and a strong desire to learn. I love learning by doing, and teaching myself new skills;
                I am a self-taught drummer, guitarist, bassist, and music producer, and have always loved building things.
                I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, and I am excited to share more about myself with you.
                </p>
