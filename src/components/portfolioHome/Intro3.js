                <p>I love gaming. I started building redstone contraptions in Minecraft back in elementary school, and I’ve since graduated to developing strategies in games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and Rainbow Six: Siege. I’m in the early stages of building an application for Counter-Strike players that calculates the angle and type of throw required for a smoke grenade to land in the chosen spot from the user's starting position.</p>

                <p>I love cooking. I experiment with recipes and kitchen techniques every day. My main focus these days are on korean food, chinese food, and anything cooked with a cast iron pan.</p>
