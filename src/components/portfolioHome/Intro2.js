                <p>I love technology and building things. I built my first computer when I was twelve years old, and I still use it today. I once motorized a chair to carry me from room to room in my house, but it eventually succumbed to my weight. In high school, I wanted a Tom Delonge signature guitar but couldn’t afford one, so I built a “student budget” replica that I still enjoy playing.

<p>I love music. I’m a fan of pop punk (blink-182, Sum 41, Neck Deep, etc.) and a self-taught drummer, guitarist, bassist, and music producer. You can find a couple of my samples in SoundCloud. </p>

<p>I love working out. I swam competitively in high school and now swim with the University of Toronto Master’s Swim Club. I also find time every week to lift weights with my friends.</p>
