                <p>Aside from my career-based interests, I enjoy listening to pop punk music (blink-182, Sum 41, Neck Deep, etc.),
                    playing the guitar, drums, and bass, and producing music. I also love creating new strategies in games like
                    Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and Rainbow Six: Siege.
